While the backend and the admin panel were crafted using Ruby on Rails, the mobile application was developed in Flutter. Users can seamlessly create content, cater to their unique audiences, and gain insights through a detailed admin panel. Additionally, I managed the meticulous task of data migration from the previous database, ensuring no information loss.`,
